            <p  ><b>To,<br /></b></p>
            <p><b>Surabhi Pranav ,<br /></b></p>
            <p>With reference to your interview, we are pleased to inform you that you have been selected as
                &#8220;<b>Web<br />Development Intern</b>&#8221; in our NGO - &#8220;Suvidha Mahila Mandal&#8221;, with
                the following terms and conditions.<br /></p>
            <p>&#9679; You will provide the <b>Web Development services and apart from Web development you have to
                    participate in the<br />fundraising task also </b>at <b>Suvidha Foundation </b>and deliver the
                effect of the work.<br /></p>
            <p>&#9679; The internship period will be from <b>17 October, 2023 to 17 November, 2023</b>.<br />&#9679;
                Your work base station is work from Home and six days a week.<br />&#9679; <b>It is an unpaid
                    internship. </b>The certificate of completion will be given only if you invest 4 hours daily on all
                working<br /></p>
            <p>days. You must participate in the daily team meetings through Google Meet. Also, the letter holds no
                value without a<br />completion certificate from us with a unique identification number, which can be
                verified online.<br /></p>
            <p>&#9679; During the internship period and thereafter, you will not give out to anyone in writing or by
                word of mouth or<br />otherwise particulars or details of work process, technical know-how, research
                carried out, security arrangements<br />and/or matters of confidential or secret nature which you may
                come across during your service in this organization.<br /></p>
            <p>&#9679; In case of any misconduct which causes financial loss to the NGO or hurts its reputation and
                goodwill of the<br />organization, the management has the right to terminate any intern. In case of
                termination, the management will not<br />be issuing certificates to the intern.<br /></p>
            <p>&#9679; It is necessary for an intern to return all the organization belongings (login credentials, media
                created, and system) at<br />the time of leaving the organization. A clearance and experience
                certificate will be given after completing the<br />formalities. If any employee leaves the
                job/Internship without completing the formality, the organization will take<br />necessary action. All
                the software/courses/data developed by the interns or any employee for the Suvidha Mahila<br />Mandal
                are intellectual property of the organization &amp; are protected by Indian Copyright Act. All the data
                generated<br />during the internship period, is the property right of organization and can be used for
                any purpose. In case of any<br />piracy, strict legal action will be taken by the organization against
                erring persons. No information or source codes or<br />course curriculum or business secrets or
                financial position or other details of organization shall be discussed among<br />friends or relatives
                or our competitors. Such leakage of information is likely to cause financial loss to the
                organization.<br />Hence, in such a case, the organization will be terminating the employee immediately
                and if required, further legal<br />action will be taken against that intern.<br /></p>
